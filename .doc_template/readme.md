## jsdoc-to-markdown template files

Most of the partials (and helpers) in this directory have been copied over from the [dmd-readable](https://github.com/DarrenPaulWright/dmd-readable/) repository because [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) user provided partials do not override plugin provided partials.
